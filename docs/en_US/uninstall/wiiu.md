# Wii U

## Switching to Nintendo Network

This section is not uninstalling - but it's what most are probably looking to do instead of completely uninstalling Nimble and/or Inkay.

When using Nimble (Tiramisu), you can hold ZL while your Wii U starts to disable Pretendo's patches.

When using Inkay (Aroma), you should wait for the Wii U Menu to load. Then, press (L)+(D-Pad Down)+(Select) to access the Wii U Plugin System menu.

Select `Inkay` by pressing (A), then select `Patching` by pressing (A) again. Then, press (D-Pad Left) to set `Skip Pretendo Network patches` to `true`.

When you press (HOME) to exit the menu, the Wii U Menu will relaunch, and you will be connected to Nintendo Network.

If you want to go back to Pretendo Network, follow these instructions again, but press (D-Pad Right) to set `Skip Pretendo Network patches` to `false`.
