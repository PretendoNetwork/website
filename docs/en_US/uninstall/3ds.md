## Switching back to Nintendo Network

This section is not uninstalling - but it's what most are probably looking to do instead of completely uninstalling Nimbus.

Run Nimbus like you would run anything from the Homebrew Launcher, and select whether you'd like to use Nintendo Network or Pretendo Network! You may freely switch between Pretendo and Nintendo at any time, and your selected network will persist between reboots.
