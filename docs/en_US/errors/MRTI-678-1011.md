# Error Code: 678-1011
**Applies to:** Wii U

---

***Note:*** This error relates to the Martini patches, which are now deprecated.

<div class="tip">
⚠️ <b>Do not reboot your console or exit Martini!</b>
</div>

The patcher encountered an error when applying the patched certificate to your system. Files essential to your Wii U's
functionality have been modified and the system may be unbootable. **Immediate action is required to avoid a brick.**

Reach out on our [Discord](https://invite.gg/pretendo). State your error code and that you have a cert brick. Be
loud and ping mods - this is the only time you're allowed ;)

Precise instructions are not provided here to ensure that you get helpers involved. For helpers and experienced users,
however, your best bet from here is to use wupclient (Tiramisu/Aroma) or FTP (Aroma) to download whatever Thwate cert is
on the console and inspect it, then upload a clean one. Users who have EnvironmentLoader in H&S can install Tiramisu and
should be able to use the boot selector to get to HBL and FTPiiU Everywhere without triggering the brick. Users without
a working coldboot setup are SOL if they reboot, though UDPIH might be able to save it.
