- "Unable to parse service Token. Are you using a Nintendo Network ID?"

This typically occurs because you are attempting to connect to Juxt with a **Nintendo Network ID** instead of a **Pretendo Network ID**.

Please ensure that the account you are using is indeed the one created for the Pretendo Network, and that you have either selected Pretendo in the 3DS Patch `nimbus.3dsx`, or have launched your Wii U with the `30_nimble.rpx` module.

If you have not yet connected to Pretendo, please follow the instructions [here](/docs/install) to get started.

If you are still unable to connect, please request to speak to a moderator in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/pretendo).
