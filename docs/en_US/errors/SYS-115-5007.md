- ""Miiverse function are unavailable to this Nintendo Network ID. For details, please start Miiverse."

This typically occurs because you are attempting to connect to Juxt with a **Nintendo Network ID** instead of a **Pretendo Network ID**.

This can also occur if your Pretendo Network ID has been banned from using Juxt.

For more information, launch the Miiverse app, or request to speak to a moderator in the [Discord server](https://invite.gg/pretendo).

If you have not yet connected to Pretendo, please follow the instructions [here](/docs/install) to get started.

If you are still unable to connect, please request to speak to a moderator in the [Discord server](https://invite.gg/pretendo).
