# Wii U

<div class="tip">
	‚ÑπÔ∏è This guide assumes that you have a real Wii U console running homebrew. If you don't, please first follow <a href="https://wiiu.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">this guide</a> on how to homebrew your system, or <a href="/docs/install/cemu">this guide</a> on how to connect to Pretendo Network on Cemu.

Welcome to Pretendo Network! [Already have Pretendo installed, but need help making your Pretendo Network ID?](#pnid-setup-1)

Select the homebrew environment you're currently using:
- ### [Tiramisu](#tiramisu-1)
- ### [Aroma](#aroma-1)
- ### [Other](#other-1)

# Tiramisu

To connect to Pretendo Network using Tiramisu, you must use the [Nimble](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble) module. There are 2 ways of obtaining the patch; either the stable release version, or the bleeding edge version.

### Stable
Download Nimble by clicking [here](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble/releases/latest/download/30_nimble.rpx). A `30_nimble.rpx` file will download. 

Place that file on your SD card at `sd:/wiiu/environments/tiramisu/modules/setup/`.

If `50_hbl_launcher.rpx` is on your SD card, remove it for now - otherwise, it'll get in the way of us making a Pretendo Network ID later. Your SD card should now look something like this:

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/tiramisu/sd-card.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Place your SD card back into your console and boot like normal. [Click here to continue setup!](#creating-and-using-a-pretendo-network-id)

### Bleeding Edge
Navigate to the [Actions](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble/actions) page on the Nimble GitHub repository.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/tiramisu/actions-highlight.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Select the `Nimble-CI` workflow and select the latest workflow run. _**Note:** At this stage you may also use the provided filters to only grab builds from specific branches, events, etc. By default the latest build, regardless of branch, is always shown._

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/tiramisu/workflow-highlight.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Select the `nimble` artifact. This will download a `nimble.zip` zip file.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/tiramisu/artifact-highlight.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Extract `nimble.zip` and place the extracted `30_nimble.rpx` file on your SD card at `sd:/wiiu/environments/tiramisu/modules/setup/`

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/tiramisu/sd-card.png" width=100% height=auto/>

# Aroma

To connect to Pretendo Network using Aroma, you must use the [Inkay](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay) plugin. There are 2 ways of obtaining the patch; either the stable release version, or the bleeding edge version.

### Stable
Download Inkay by clicking [here](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Inkay/releases/latest/download/Inkay-pretendo.wps). A `Inkay-pretendo.wps` file will download. Place the downloaded `Inkay-pretendo.wps` file on your SD card at `sd:/wiiu/environments/aroma/plugins/`.

# Other

Pretendo does not officially support other homebrew environments anymore, such as legacy ones including Haxchi/CBHC. **Please consider upgrading to Tiramisu/Aroma.**

Legacy releases of the patcher may be found in old [releases](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble/releases), and the source code may be found in the [old_hbl](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble/tree/old_hbl) and [old_hbl_inkay](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimble/tree/old_hbl_inkay) branches on GitHub. However, you will need to build these patches from source, and they will *NOT* be receiving any updates or technical support.

# Creating and using a Pretendo Network ID

Now that Pretendo Network's basic patches have been installed, we can create a Pretendo Network ID. There are currently two ways of creating a PNID; either by directly creating an account on your Wii U, or creating it with the website and linking later.

<div class="tip red">
	‚ö†Ô∏è When registering for a PNID, make sure to save your password on some sort of note, as you are *not* be able to reset your password at this time. 
	<!-- TODO: There's currently a pull request for the website that, 
	once merged, will make this notice obsolete and let the password 
	reset feature go live! üéâ 
	https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/website/pull/177 -->
</div>

### Wii U

Start up your Wii U and get to the user selection screen. For some users, this will be where they first go, but others may have to press a profile icon in the top-left. After pressing the icon, press `Switch Account` or `Switch User`.

Once you get to the user selection screen, press (Plus) or `Add New User`. 

When asked if you already have a Nintendo Network ID, choose `No`. You will immediately be greeted with a language selection that will take you to a Network Services Agreement.

**STOP!** Read carefully, and make sure that this is the Pretendo Network Services Agreement and not just the regular Network Services Agreement.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pretendo-eula.png" width=100% height=auto/>

If it reads as above (or, at the very least, mentions Pretendo), then you're connected to Pretendo Network and can progress safely. Otherwise, make sure you've [installed Pretendo Network's basic patches](#select-your-homebrew-environment).

Specify your birth date, gender, state / province if necessary, and timezone.

Now it's time to... create your "Nintendo Network ID!" This is actually your *Pretendo* Network ID. Remember, do not use the same Pretendo Network ID as your current Nintendo Network ID. The Wii U will not let you add what it thinks is a Nintendo Network ID more than once.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pnid-username.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Once you've made your Pretendo Network ID and your password, you get to tell Pretendo whether or not you want you want to be able to login to your Pretendo Network ID through your other devices, on services like Miiverse.

You *also* get to register an email to your Pretendo Network ID, and get to tell Pretendo whether or not you want to stay in touch via e-mail. (More realistically, though, you'd stay in touch via [our Discord server](https://invite.gg/pretendo).)

Once you've confirmed that everything is good, the Wii U will tell you a confirmation email has been sent.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pnid-confirmation.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Don't go looking for it. *It doesn't exist.* Pretendo Network IDs cannot have emails confirmed at this time.

You've now created and started using a Pretendo Network ID! Keep scrolling past this section to learn about how to install Juxtaposition and restore the functionality of the YouTube app.

### Website
Go to the account login page [here](/account) and click `Don't have an account?` to register.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/register-account-web.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Do not use the same Pretendo Network ID as your current Nintendo Network ID. The Wii U will not let you add what it thinks is a Nintendo Network ID more than once.

After registering, start up your Wii U and login as a user you currently have. Press the profile icon in the top-left.

If you *did* get error 102-2402 when logging in, then you're connected to Pretendo! If you didn't, you can still check. Scroll all the way down, and choose `View Network Services Agreement`.

**STOP!** Read carefully, and make sure that this is the Pretendo Network Services Agreement and not just the regular Network Services Agreement.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pretendo-eula2.png" width=100% height=auto/>

If it reads as above (or, at the very least, mentions Pretendo), then you're connected to Pretendo Network and can progress safely. Otherwise, make sure you've [installed Pretendo Network's basic patches](#select-your-homebrew-environment).

Now that we've checked, scroll back up to continue along.

Press `Switch Account` or `Switch User` to get to the user selection screen, then press (Plus) or `Add New User`. 

When asked if you already have a Nintendo Network ID, choose `Yes`. Say `Yes` again when it asks if you want to link an existing ID.

Enter the username, password, and email we entered on the website.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pnid-username2.png" width=100% height=auto/>

After confirming the information is correct, you'll be asked if you're sure that you want to link the account. Choose `Link`.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pnid-link.png" width=100% height=auto/>

You've now created and started using a Pretendo Network ID!

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pnid-created.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Note that whenever you login to your account, you may see a screen like this:

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/pnid/pnid-confirmation2.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Do not go looking for a confirmation email. *It doesn't exist.* Pretendo Network IDs cannot have emails confirmed at this time.

# Setting up the Juxtaposition applet (optional)

Some games come with Miiverse support. Juxtaposition, or Juxt for short, is our Miiverse reimagining. Nimble and Inkay already take care of in-game patches for Miiverse, but the applet can also be patched separately.

Note that the modifications Martini makes are "permanent" - they can be reverted, but unlike our other patches, they write to a console's NAND and persist across reboots. At this time, Juxt cannot be uninstalled once you patch the applet.

You can also access Juxtaposition using a Nintendo Network ID, although note that when doing so, you will be in Guest Mode, which limits you from Yeahing posts or making posts of your own.

If you use Tiramisu, this is the time where you will likely want to re-add `50_hbl_launcher.rpx`. We'll start by doing that.

Download the ZIP file by clicking [here](https://github.com/wiiu-env/HBLInstallerWrapper/releases/download/v0.1/HBLInstallerWrapper_20220905-095513.zip). Extract it, and then copy `50_hbl_launcher.rpx` to `sd:/wiiu/environments/tiramisu/modules/setup/`.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/tiramisu/sd-card-hbl.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Download the Juxtaposition patcher by clicking [here](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Martini/releases/download/v0.3/martini-juxt-patcher.rpx). Copy `martini-juxt-patcher.rpx` and place it on your SD card at `sd:/wiiu/apps/`.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/juxt/martini-sd-card.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Place your SD card back into your console and boot like normal.

If you use Tiramisu, open Mii Maker to get to the Homebrew Launcher.

Launch `martini-juxt-patcher.rpx`.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/juxt/martini-hbl.png" width=100% height=auto/>

After confirming the state of the Miiverse applet, press A to apply the patches.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/juxt/martini-install.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Once the patcher is done running and your console has rebooted, you're done! The Juxtaposition applet has now been installed.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/juxt/martini-success.png" width=100% height=auto/>

If you're on Tiramisu and you'd like to access Mii Maker again, remove `50_hbl_launcher.rpx` from `sd:/wiiu/environments/tiramisu/modules/setup/`.

Have fun!

# Restoring the functionality of the YouTube app (optional)

The YouTube app was discontinued on October 27th, 2022. GiveMiiYouTube is a plugin *for Aroma only* that makes the YouTube app work again.

Download GiveMiiYouTube by clicking [here](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/GiveMiiYouTube/releases/latest/download/GiveMiiYouTube.wps). Copy `GiveMiiYouTube.wps` and place it on your SD card at `sd:/wiiu/environments/aroma/plugins/`.

<img src="/assets/images/docs/install/wiiu/aroma/sd-card-youtube.png" width=100% height=auto/>

Place your SD card back into your console and boot like normal.

That's it!
