# 3DS

### In Game Patches

Nimbus already takes care of most in game patches for miiverse, so you're already good to go!

### Applet Patch

First, download `Juxt.zip` from [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/911878047895023637/937516295069515866/Juxt.zip).

Extract `Juxt.zip` and copy the `3ds` and `luma` folders to the root of your SD card. You should now have the `000400300000BC02`, `000400300000BD02`, and `000400300000BE02` Luma patches along with the `juxt.pem` cert

Place your SD card back into your console. Boot your console and ensure Luma patches are enabled.

That's it! Have fun in Juxt!
