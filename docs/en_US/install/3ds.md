# 3DS/2DS Family

<div class="tip">
	ℹ️ This guide assumes that you have a real 3DS/2DS family system running homebrew (the Luma3DS custom firmware, to be more specific). If you don't, please follow this <a href="https://3ds.hacks.guide/" target="_blank">guide</a> on how to homebrew your system first.
</div>

To connect to Pretendo Network using a 3DS/2DS family system, you must use the Nimbus homebrew and Luma patches.

Download the `nimbus.zip` file by clicking [here](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimbus/releases/latest/download/nimbus.zip). Extract `nimbus.zip`, and copy the `3ds` and `luma` folders to the root of your SD card. You should now have the `0004013000002F02`, `0004013000003202`, and `0004013000003802` Luma patches, along with the `nimbus.3dsx` homebrew.

Place your SD card back into your console.

Turn on your console and hold (Select) *at the same time* to load the Luma3DS configuration menu. Make sure that game patches are enabled; if they're not, select it before pressing (Start) to exit to the home menu.

Run Nimbus like you would run anything from the Homebrew Launcher, and select whether you'd like to use Nintendo Network or Pretendo Network! You may freely switch between Pretendo and Nintendo at any time, and your selected network will persist between reboots.

# Creating a Pretendo Network ID

Now that Pretendo Network's patches have been installed, we can create a Pretendo Network ID.

Run the Nimbus homebrew, and select *Pretendo*. Your screen will go black and you'll be taken to the home menu. You're on the Pretendo Network!

At this time, you cannot create a Pretendo Network ID from your 3DS/2DS family system; you must make it from the website or <a href="/docs/install/wiiu">from a Wii U</a>. 

To do so from the website, go to the account login page [here](/account) and click `Don't have an account?` to register.

Do not use the same Pretendo Network ID as your current Nintendo Network ID. The 3DS will not let you add the same ID more than once.

Go into *System Settings* > *Nintendo Network ID Settings*.

If you'd additionally like to setup Miiverse, [head here to learn how](/docs/install/juxt).
