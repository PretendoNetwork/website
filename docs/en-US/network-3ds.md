### What you need
Nimbus [Github](https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/nimbus/releases)


## Usage
1. Extract to the root of your 3DS SD card
2. Ensure Game Patching is enabled in Luma3DS settings (hold SELECT at boot to enter Luma settings)
3. Run the Nimbus homebrew and select the network you wish to use (Nintendo Network, or Pretendo Network)

When Nimbus is in Pretendo mode, you will have a new separate Friend Code for Pretendo - this is expected, and you **will still have your Nintendo Network Friend Code** when you return to Nintendo Network by setting the appropriate server in-app.
