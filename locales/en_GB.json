		"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
		"text": "Here are some common questions we're asked for easy information.",
		"QAs": [
			{
				"question": "What is Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Pretendo is an open source Nintendo Network replacement that aims to build custom servers for the Wii U and 3DS family of consoles. Our goal is to preserve the online functionality of these consoles, to allow players to continue to play their favourite Wii U and 3DS games to their fullest capacity."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will my existing NNIDs work on Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Sadly, no. Existing NNIDs will not work on Pretendo, as only Nintendo holds your user data; while an NNID-to-PNID migration is theoretically possible, it would be risky and require sensitive user data we do not wish to hold."
			},
			{
				"question": "How do I use Pretendo?",
				"answer": "To get started with Pretendo Network on 3DS, Wii U or emulators, please see our <a href='/docs/install'>setup instructions</a>!"
			},
			{
				"question": "Do you know when feature/service will be ready?",
				"answer": "No. Lots of Pretendo's features/services are developed independently (for example, Miiverse may be worked on by one developer while Accounts and Friends is being worked on by another) and therefore we cannot give an overall ETA for how long this will take."
			},
			{
				"question": "When will you add more games?",
				"answer": "We work on new games once we feel that our backend libraries are ready to support it, and there is developer time available to maintain it. A lot of our work goes into stabilising and completing our existing games - we want to get the best experience possible in those before we move on to new titles. Since new work comes up all the time, we cannot make any estimate of when that would be."
			},
			{
				"question": "If I use an emulator, will that be enough to use Pretendo?",
				"answer": "No. For purposes of security and moderation, if you are using an emulator, you still need a real console. This allows for improved security and more effective enforcement of rules in order to provide a safe and enjoyable experience with our service."
			},
			{
				"question": "Does Pretendo work on Cemu/emulators?",
				"answer": "Cemu 2.1 officially supports Pretendo under your network account options in the emulator. For information on how to get started with Cemu, check out the <a href=\"https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu\">documentation</a>.<br>Some 3DS emulators or forks might support us, but we do not have any official recommendation or setup instructions at this time. The final builds of Citra do not support Pretendo."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will Pretendo support the Wii/Switch?",
				"answer": "The Wii already has custom servers provided by <a href=\"https://wiimmfi.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Wiimmfi</a>. We currently do not wish to target the Switch as it is both paid and completely different to Nintendo Network."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will I need hacks to connect?",
				"answer": "For the best experience on consoles, you will need to hack your system - specifically Aroma for Wii U and Luma3DS for 3DS. However, on Wii U, the hackless SSSL method is also available with limited functionality. See our <a href=\"/docs/install\">setup instructions</a> for details."
			},
			{
				"question": "If I am banned on Nintendo Network, will I stay banned when using Pretendo?",
				"answer": "We do not have access to Nintendo Network's bans, so all Nintendo Network users are not banned. However, we have rules to follow when using the service and failing to follow these rules could result in a ban."
			},
			{
				"question": "Can I use cheats or mods online with Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Only in private matches - gaining an unfair advantage or disrupting the online experience with people who didn't consent (as in public matches) is a bannable offence. We regularly apply account and console bans to both Wii U and 3DS systems. Pretendo uses extra security measures that make traditional 'unban' methods like changing your serial number ineffective."
