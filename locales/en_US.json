		"title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
		"text": "Here are some common questions we're asked for easy information.",
		"QAs": [
			{
				"question": "What is Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Pretendo is an open source Nintendo Network replacement that aims to build custom servers for the Wii U and 3DS family of consoles. Our goal is to preserve the online functionality of these consoles, to allow players to continue to play their favorite Wii U and 3DS games to their fullest capacity."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will my existing NNIDs work on Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Sadly, no. Existing NNIDs will not work on Pretendo, as only Nintendo holds your user data; while an NNID-to-PNID migration is theoretically possible, it would be risky and require sensitive user data we do not wish to hold."
			},
			{
				"question": "How do I use Pretendo?",
				"answer": "Pretendo is currently not in a state that is ready for public use. However, once it is you will be able to use Pretendo simply by running our homebrew patcher on your console."
			},
			{
				"question": "Do you know when feature/service will be ready?",
				"answer": "No. Lots of Pretendo's features/services are developed independently (for example, Miiverse may be worked on by one developer while Accounts and Friends is being worked on by another) and therefore we cannot give an overall ETA for how long this will take."
			},
			{
				"question": "Does Pretendo work on Cemu/emulators?",
				"answer": "Pretendo supports any client that can interact with Nintendo Network. Currently the only emulator with this kind of functionality is Cemu. Cemu 2.0 officially supports Pretendo under your network account options in the emulator. For information on how to get started with Cemu, check out the <a href='https://pretendo.network/docs/install/cemu'>documentation</a>.<br>Citra does not support true online play and thus does not work with Pretendo, and does not show signs of supporting true online play at all. Mikage, a 3DS emulator for mobile devices, may provide support in the future though this is far from certain."
			},
			{
				"question": "If I am banned on Nintendo Network, will I stay banned when using Pretendo?",
				"answer": "We will not have access to Nintendo Network's bans, and all users will not be banned on our service. However, we will have rules to follow when using the service and failing to follow these rules could result in a ban."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will Pretendo support the Wii/Switch?",
				"answer": "The Wii already has custom servers provided by <a href=\"https://wiimmfi.de/\" target=\"_blank\">Wiimmfi</a>. We currently do not wish to target the Switch as it is both paid and completely different to Nintendo Network."
			},
			{
				"question": "Will I need hacks to connect?",
				"answer": "Yes, you will need to hack your device to connect; however, on Wii U you will only need access to the Homebrew Launcher (i.e. Haxchi, Coldboot Haxchi, or even the web browser exploit), with info on how the 3DS will connect coming at a later date."
