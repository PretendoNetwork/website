Today we are releasing 2 big features for the 3DS: 3DS system notifications and StreetPass Relay!

***(Do note that both features are currently in active development, and may not always function properly. A common solution is to remove and reinsert your system's battery, in order to load the latest policylist, however do note this will have side effects in time-based games! It is common for some users to have one, or both, features not function. These issues are being looked in to)***

# System Notifications
We can now send your 3DS systems notifications using the built-in notifications app! This allows us to deliver news updates right to your console, without needing to be in our Discord server, forum, or even following our social media. You can get all the latest news about the service, right from the console you're using it on!

***Not all announcements may make it to the system notifications however, namely very long announcements or those which require rich media like links, images, videos, and more.***

# StreetPass Relay
StreetPass Relay was a feature built into the 3DS which allows users to gain "StreetPass'" from other users, even without physically being near them at the time. This worked by using a "StreetPass Relay Point", a wireless access point used by Nintendo Zone to store StreetPass data. When connecting to one of these relays, your console would upload your own StreetPass data as well as download the data of others from that relay.

With our implementation, StreetPass Relay now works ***GLOBALLY***, removing the need to be at a physical access point! You can now passively gain passes with other Pretendo users simply by being online. There are 2 things note, however:

1. ***You must be using the latest release of Nimbus for StreetPass Relay to function. Previous versions do not have the correct URL patches for StreetPass Relay. You can download the latest release here https://github.com/PretendoNetwork/Nimbus/releases/latest***
2. ***Due to the [questionable quality](https://twitter.com/MrNbaYoh/status/1783912413068222477) of the StreetPass parsers inside games and the fact that StreetPass Relay happens automatically, you can ONLY gain passes with people who you are friends with on the 3DS friends server. You will NOT be able to gain passes from any other users through StreetPass Relay.***
