Oh boy another recap post! This time we're going to talk a little bit about Juxtaposition now and what our plans are going forward.

## First off, what is Juxtaposition?
Juxtaposition (or Juxt for short) is the Pretendo Network Miiverse replacement. This includes but is not limited to:
- Wii U App
- 3DS App
- Game API
- And more!

Juxt isn't the entirety of the Pretendo Network, it's a small but core piece that makes the entire network work in harmony.

## A brief history
Juxt started out before I actually even joined the Pretendo Network development team. In 2019 I contacted [quarky](https://heyquark.com/) about their [miiverse-api-poc](https://github.com/QuarkTheAwesome/miiverse-api-poc) server that had support for the Splatoon Plaza posts, and that was it. The original intent was to take the software and build off of it to generate files for Wara Wara Plaza.

> Hello World! Check out the very first instance of Wara Wara Plaza rendering a custom file. A bit underwhelming looking back huh?

From there we quickly realized that the scope of this project was going to be much larger than we though, and moved on to experimenting with the Miiverse Applet itself

Shortly after this the project was absorbed into the Pretendo Network, and our full focus was put onto getting the Miiverse Applet patched and working.

2020 was a big year for Juxt, going from the simple api server before, to rapidly building out its web interface and features across both the 3DS and Wii u

## Enough rambling, what works?

Believe it or not Juxt is actually fairly well featured at the moment! Here's a ~~brief~~ list of what’s working for the 3DS and Wii U now.
